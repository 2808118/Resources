# Resources (other than journal articles) for current and future me
A place to put learning, teaching, and other online resources I found useful.

## Learning Resurces

### Dirichlet process
* [Nonparametric Bayesian Methods: Models, Algorithms, and Applications I](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tamara-broderick-michael-jordan-01-25-2017-1)

### Hidden Markov Models
* [Hidden Markov Models and State Estimation](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/dst/18/lectures/24/lecture-24.html)

## Teaching Resources

### Datasets
* [palmerpenguins R data package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) (alternative to iris dataset)

### Art
* [Allison Horst's statistics and R illustrations](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)

### Explanations
* [The difference between probability and statistics](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/jaialai/excerpts/node12.html)

### Advice for online teaching
* [9 Ways Online Teaching Should be Different from Face-to-Face](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/9-ways-online-teaching/)

* https://www.higheredjobs.com/
* https://careers.insidehighered.com/
* https://jobs.chronicle.com/jobs/mathematics/ (don’t forget that some “stat jobs” will be within mathematics departments)

### Advice for the job search
* At JSM, the isolated statisticians working meeting will feature faculty who are looking to hire.
* Draft teaching and research statements over the summer, and send them to your committee for feedback.
* For smaller schools, applications are as early as October 1 and as late as November. For research universities, deadlines are much later.
* Put a lot of thought into cover letter. 
* Be clear about what courses you want to teach and how you teach in your teaching statement. Have online course notes
