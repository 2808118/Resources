* https://forms.stat.ufl.edu/statistics-jobs/
* https://www.higheredjobs.com/
* https://careers.insidehighered.com/
* https://jobs.chronicle.com/jobs/mathematics/ (don’t forget that some “stat jobs” will be within mathematics departments)

### Advice for the job search
* At JSM, the isolated statisticians working meeting will feature faculty who are looking to hire.
* Draft teaching and research statements over the summer, and send them to your committee for feedback.
* For smaller schools, applications are as early as October 1 and as late as November. For research universities, deadlines are much later.
* Put a lot of thought into cover letter. 
* Be clear about what courses you want to teach and how you teach in your teaching statement. Have online course notes 

## Textbooks recommended by me or others

### For students
* A undergraduate-level probability and Bayesian statistics textbook called [Probability and Bayesian Modeling by Jim Albert and Monika Hu](https://monika76five.github.io/ProbBayes/)
* Introductory statistics textbook called [OpenIntro Statistics by David Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Christopher Barr, and OpenIntro:](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) A complete foundation for Statistics, also serving as a foundation for Data Science
* Design of experiments textbooks focusing on social science
  * Gerber, A.S. and Green, D.P., 2012. Field experiments: Design, analysis, and interpretation. WW Norton. (recommended by Philip Waggoner)
  * Dunning, T., 2012. Natural experiments in the social sciences: a design-based approach. Cambridge University Press. (recommended by Philip Waggoner)
  * Design and Analysis of Experiments, 10th Edition Douglas C. Montgomery (recommended by Oluremi Abayomi).
    * very detailed and extensive in its development of the conceptual and logical principles that underpin the design of experiments
