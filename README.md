## Textbooks recommended by me or others

### For students
* A undergraduate-level probability and Bayesian statistics textbook called [Probability and Bayesian Modeling by Jim Albert and Monika Hu](https://monika76five.github.io/ProbBayes/)
* Introductory statistics textbook called [OpenIntro Statistics by David Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Christopher Barr, and OpenIntro:](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) A complete foundation for Statistics, also serving as a foundation for Data Science
* Design of experiments textbooks focusing on social science
  * Gerber, A.S. and Green, D.P., 2012. Field experiments: Design, analysis, and interpretation. WW Norton. (recommended by Philip Waggoner)
  * Dunning, T., 2012. Natural experiments in the social sciences: a design-based approach. Cambridge University Press. (recommended by Philip Waggoner)
  * Design and Analysis of Experiments, 10th Edition Douglas C. Montgomery (recommended by Oluremi Abayomi).
    * very detailed and extensive in its development of the conceptual and logical principles that underpin the design of experiments
    * Although Montgomery's book is probably the most widely used, it isn't super accessible
  * Cobb, G.W. (2014). Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiments. Wiley. (recommended by Megan Lutz)
    * it also has some drawbacks (no solutions manual! some key omitted topics! approach to decomposing SSs doesn't extend past two-way designs!) BUT it is an intuitive approach and provides a great visualization method for decomposition and partitioning the data, and does not require calculus or linear algebra to do it.
  * [a free online textbook for design of experiments by Gary W. Oehlert](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~gary/book/fcdae.pdf) which no one has read in detail. Free online PDF, no print version is available that I'm aware of.
  * Dean and Voss, Design and Analysis of Experiments with Martha Smith's 2009 [online notes](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/384E09/M384Esp09home.html)
* For teaching blind students (look at isostat tread "Teaching intro stat to a blind student")
  * [BraileR in Action](https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/BrailleRInAction/)
* [Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse!, by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim](https://moderndive.com)
* [Introduction to Statistical Investigations by Rossman and Chance](http://www.isi-stats.com)
* [Investigating Statistical Concepts, Aplications, and Methods, third edition by Beth L Chance and Allan J Rossman](http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/)
  * so many applets!
* Statistical Inference via Data Science, by Ismay/Kim, is free online and retails for $79.95 in paperback.
* An Introduction to Statistical Learning, by James/Witten/Hastie/Tibshirani, is free in PDF and is available in print for $79.99 retail.
* A list of additional textbooks that are free online or free in PDF are listed at the following page (far from a comprehensive list):
https://www.openintro.org/book/os#more_free_books
* [a free probability text by Grinstead and Snell](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf) This is appropriate for the usual calculus-based probability course. Based on the relatively little I’ve seen, I like this book because it has good verbal explanations.
* [Linear Algebra, A Free text for a standard US undergraduate course by Jim Hefferon ](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/)
* Another book for math stats that focuses on simulation for inference and the traditional math stats examples is the Chihara and Hesterberg book. There are also simulations for understanding discussed. (Adam Loy)
* a biostat book with great connection of probability and stat theory is https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Solutions-Biostatistical-Chapman-Statistical-ebook/dp/B005H6L6YG (John Bailer)
* I wrote a book that uses R throughout and introduces statistics along with the probability. https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/foundations-and-applications-of-statistics-an-introduction-using-r (Randall Pruim)
* The textbook Beyond Multiple Linear Regression: Applied Generalized Linear Models and Multilevel Models in R by Roback and Legler is now freely available at  https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ , and the source code and associated data sets are available at  https://github.com/proback/BeyondMLR .  This is an updated version of the textbook formerly known as Broadening Your Statistical Horizons (BYSH); while core topics and structure and case studies remain the same, this version represents a noticeable improvement -- more exercises, more clarity, and more fun!  If you've been looking for an applied presentation of GLMs and multilevel models for advanced undergraduates, feel free to check out these materials and use anything that appears useful.

### Advice for the job search
* At JSM, the isolated statisticians working meeting will feature faculty who are looking to hire.
* Draft teaching and research statements over the summer, and send them to your committee for feedback.
* For smaller schools, applications are as early as October 1 and as late as November. For research universities, deadlines are much later.
* Put a lot of thought into cover letter. 
* Be clear about what courses you want to teach and how you teach in your teaching statement. Have online course notes
