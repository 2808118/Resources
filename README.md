## Getting a job

### Where to find job listings
* https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list
* https://jobs.chronicle.com/jobs/statistics/
* https://forms.stat.ufl.edu/statistics-jobs/
* https://www.higheredjobs.com/
* https://careers.insidehighered.com/
* https://jobs.chronicle.com/jobs/mathematics/ (don’t forget that some “stat jobs” will be within mathematics departments)
* https://jobs.amstat.org/jobs/
* Less helpful - https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs
* http://mdogucu.ics.uci.edu/service/isostat/tt-search-2019

### Advice for the job search
* At JSM, the isolated statisticians working meeting will feature faculty who are looking to hire.
* Draft teaching and research statements over the summer, and send them to your committee for feedback.
* For smaller schools, applications are as early as October 1 and as late as November. For research universities, deadlines are much later.
* Put a lot of thought into cover letter. 
* Be clear about what courses you want to teach and how you teach in your teaching statement. Have online course notes 

## Textbooks

### For students
* [A undergraduate-level probability and Bayesian statistics textbook called "Probability and Bayesian Modeling" by Jim Albert and Monika Hu](https://monika76five.github.io/ProbBayes/)
